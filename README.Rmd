title: CaLenTex â€“ Calendar LaTeX
output: amaryaml::github

# Introduction

CaLenTex is a straight-forward bash script which allows you to automatically
generate a yearly calendar based on the current year. The best thing about LaTeX
is its ability to typeset beautiful documents. On the other hand, the best thing
about shell scripts is their ability to easily automate repetitive tasks such as
typesetting a calendar in LaTeX... So why should we not merge the best of both
worlds? That is essentially what this project is.
